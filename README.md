I worked through a Youtube video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_vRvDAZuOo&t=940s

The main topic of the video is the ReduxJS/Toolkit library. But the tutorial covers a broad survey of React skills. 

There is a main branch with the finished app and there are 7 branches that capture the code at different stages: 

001_Set_up_project
002_Routing_with_react-router-dom
003_Navigation_bar
004_Displaying_cart_items_using_Redux_Toolkit
005_Doing_the_API_call_using_Redux_Toolkit
006_Doing_better_with_the_thunk_part
007_Replacing_the_string_constants
